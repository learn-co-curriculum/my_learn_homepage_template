# ANNOUNCEMENTS

## 03/04/20: Study Group time/style survey

- [Please fill out this short survey about the time slot and format of our study groups.](https://forms.gle/ndhEdV5HZ2bTpyw48)
- This is a different form than the end-of-module survey and is only about study groups.
  - Thanks!

## 02/18/2020: Turning in & Scheduling Mod 3 Project Reviews

- Please **schedule your project review** with me by the **morning of Monday 02/24/20**
  - [https://go.oncehub.com/ModProjectReviews](https://go.oncehub.com/ModProjectReviews)

- Project Reviews will be held from 02/25/20 - 03/09/20
- You must **successfully pass your project review with me by 03/09/20.**


## 02/14/2020: Announcing Flatiron Data Science Curriculum v2.1

**We are excited to announce a revision of our Data Science Curriculum (v2.1). We are launching v2.1 for your cohort on Friday, February 14th, 2020.**


- Because of this, we will now be follling a new break schedule which means **we will have an bonus break week next week (02/17-02/21/2020).**

- This also means you have *another week before your Mod 3 project links are due.*<br>

#### The new deadline for the mod 3 project is Monday 02/24/2020


#### What‚Äôs New

For the Curriculum V2.1, **we‚Äôve moved content around and restructured our curriculum to 5 modules**. Your cohort is **continuing with your curriculum in the new v2.1 Module 3**. You will have an end-of-module project, and at the end of the program, there is still one big capstone project. The table below outlines the general structure for curriculum V2.1.¬†


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/online-ds-pt-100719/master/compare_curric.png?token=AKWNGY4X5S2G3ZIRPRGJ5AC6KV54C">

#### The three biggest changes to this new curriculum are

- We‚Äôve reorganized the content to fit into a 5 module-structure instead of a 7 module-structure. This standardizes the number of weeks spent in each module and for part-time, each module will last 8-weeks.
- Supporting content has been moved to an appendix in each module. This prioritizes the most important topics allowing time for you to more deeply understand these topics. The appendices are there for you to explore, as areas of interest, but are not required.
- Some sections were consolidated and some labs were updated to accommodate the new structure. We also incorporated improvements to bring the curriculum more in-line with the needs of the market.




#### Impact

In v2.1, each new Module will be deployed in a new track. To access the new track when you are ready to start your next module, please follow these step.

**Steps to access your lessons:**
- Log in to Learn.¬†
- In the top left, click onto ‚ÄúCurriculum‚Äù¬†
- Click ‚Äúswitch course‚Äù in the dropdown.¬†
- You should see a track titled ‚ÄúModule 2 - Data Science Career 2.1‚Äù
- Click on that, and it will take you to the course.¬†
- From there, go to Section 20 - ‚ÄòExtensions to Linear Models‚Äô and continue on with your curriculum!


**The updated v2.1 Curriculum Mod 2 track will be available on Friday.**
 Because we are moving to this new format where each new Module will live its own track, ***the percentage complete graphic on your cohort homepage will be incorrect.*** Please disregard this for now.¬†We‚Äôll be working in the coming weeks to update these graphics. 
 
 ***You may also see a few past lessons you completed are now no longer complete. This will not impact your graduation date and you can go back and review and mark incomplete lessons in previous modules complete if you like.***

If you have any questions, please reach out to me. I‚Äôd be happy to help you make the most of this updated curriculum!

You can also join an open office hour with me on Tuesday 02/28 at¬†6 pm (normal study group time slot).

## II. MODULE PROJECT INFO/PROCESS

- Your projects and associated Learn.co lessons can all be found on the [Portfolio Projects Section](https://learn.co/tracks/data-science-career-v2/portfolio-projects) on Learn.
- Project deadlines are on the Google Calendar at the top of this homepage.

### PROJECT SUBMISSIONS

#### 1. "Soft" Deadline AKA "Project Links Deadline"

- Full time: 1 week after project start date.
- Part time: 2 weeks after project start date.

- All required project links must be **entered on the sidebar of the project's Learn.co lesson page** and make sure to **check "I'm done"** at the bottom of the sidebar.
  - Note: you can continue to update your project after turning in the links.

- **Schedule your project review as soon as you turn in your links** (see next section below.)

- **Q: What if I don't have all pieces of my project finished by the soft deadline?**

  - For your notebook and presentation: 

    - You may continue to update your repo's contents up until your scheduled project review.

  - For the video/blog post/READMEs:
    - See "HOW TO USE PLACEHOLDER LINKS FOR Videos & Blog Posts" below

#### 2. SCHEDULE YOUR PROJECT REVIEW

- Use the link below to schedule your project review with me ASAP.
  - [Schedule a Project Review](https://go.oncehub.com/ModProjectReviews)
  - The earlier you schedule your first review, the more time you will have to schedule a second review, if required. 
  - Please push any final changes before your scheduled project review.

#### 3. "Hard" Deadline AKA "Successfully Passing Your Project Review" Deadline

- YOU **MUST SUCCESSFULLY PASS YOUR PROJECT REVIEW WITHIN 2 WEEKS AFTER THE SOFT DEADLINE** / PROJECT LINK DEADLINE.

- You are allowed **as many project review attempts** as you can fit in before the hard deadline.

- Schedule your first review as soon as possible, so you have sufficient time to re-present the project before the hard deadline.

### HOW TO: PROJECT README, PLACEHOLDER VIDEO AND BLOG POST LINKS

<details>
  <summary style="font-weight:50%;">HOW TO USE PLACEHOLDER LINKS FOR Videos & Blog Posts</summary>

- **I highly recommend making an account with a url-shortening service that allows you to edit the destination url *after creation*.**
- I recommend www.rebrandly.com, but there are other services out there.

#### Blog post: 
  - Please think of at least a title for your blog post and  publish your rough draft/placeholder to get a blog post url.
  - If you can't think of one, use an updatable short url from rebrandly.

#### Video: two options.

  - Create a shortened url that you can redirect (PREFERRED OPTION) 
    - Use a placeholder YouTube video link to create your video url.
    - Later on, you can come back to rebrandly to edit the link that your shortened url redirects to.
  - Submit any YouTube video link, either appropriate or humorous, up to you (NON-PREFERRED OPTION)

#### README: See below for instructions on turning your notebook into a README for your repo.
</details>
<!-- ## MOD 1

[Rubric](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1trk8eamU3uLpsgdmEjt5x-zKg3kFuOja/view?usp=sharing)

### Items due for Project
  * Project Notebook(s)
  * Slideshow (pdf)
  * Slideshow Video
  * Blog Post (1000 words)
  * README.md  -->

### How To: convert your project notebook into the repo's README

**There are two methods:**

1. Command line method:
Launch a terminal in the same folder as your notebook.

```bash

jupyter nbconvert --to markdown notebook_name.ipynb
mv README.md README_old.md
mv notebook_name.md README.md
```

2. Jupyter Notebook GUI method:

- Select `File` > `Download as` > `Markdown`
  - Notebook + output images will be downloaded a zip file.
  - Extract contents of zip folder to main folder of repo.
  - Rename the original `README.md` to `README_old.md`
  - Rename the notebook.md to `README.md`

___

## III. HOW TO INSTALL UPDATED `learn-env` WITH THE NEW REPO/LESSON

- Read and clone the new lesson's repo [GitHub Link](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-data-science-env)
  - Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-data-science-env`
  - cd into repo: `cd dsc-data-science-env`
  - If `learn-env` is already installed jump down to ["updating-your-virtual-environment"](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dsc-data-science-env#updating-your-virtual-environment)
    - Run these commands

    ```shell
      conda activate base # To make sure you're not in the learn-env environment
      conda remove -n learn-env --all # To get rid of the environment
      conda env list # Make sure it doesn't list learn-env - if it does, try the last step again
      ```

  - Enter the command to create `learn-env`:
    ```bash
    # for mac:
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    # for windows:
    conda env create -f windows.yml
    ```

### Make sure learn shows up in your jupyter notebook kernels:

- Type this command into terminal:<br>
  `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=learn-env`

### **To set learn-env as your default env** (so you won't have to activate it each time)

-  Enter the following command into your terminal (Windows Users See Warning Below)<br>
`echo "conda activate learn-env" >> ~/.bash_profile` 
- **BONUS HACK:** Run this to create a "jnb" shortcut that allows you to type `jnb` to open jupyter notebook.
  ```echo "alias jnb='jupyter notebook'">>~/.bash_profile```
  - Note: if you are using a different shell besides bash, you will need to find out its equivalent of `.bash_profile`

- **NOTE: WINDOWS USERS WARNING, THE INSTRUCTIONS HAVE AN ERROR:**
  - Change "conda activate learn-env" to whatever you normally type to activate your `learn-env`.
    - For most windows users its actually "`source activate learn-env`".
  - The corrected command is `echo "source activate learn-env" >> ~/.bash_profile`

- **To manually make edits/corrections to your `.bash_profile`:**
  - Launch a new terminal in its default folder (or type `cd ~`
  - Then type `open .bash_profile`

___

## IV. Installing and activating Jupyter Notebook Extensions - [Study Group Video on JNE](https://youtu.be/Fl7Xwr_kUkw)

- In your terminal enter the following commands:

  ```shell
  conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
  jupyter nbextension enable jupyter_nbextensions_configurator
  ```

- When you boot up jupyter notebook, click on the new tab called `nbextensions` on the jupyter notebook home page and check out the list of available extensions.
  - If the list of available notebook extensions is grayed out:
    - Uncheck "`disable configuration for nbextensions without explicit compatibility (they may break your notebook environment, but can be useful to show for nbextension development)`" at the top of the page

- **Recommended extensions to turn on:**
  - `Variable Inspector`: Lets you see details about all of the variables in your notebook.
  - `Table of Contents (2)`: Clickable sidebar with markdown headers as bookmarks/links.
  - `Collapsible Headings`: Collapse sections of your notebook using markdown headers.
  - `Codefolding`: Lets you collapse function definitions and blocks of code.
