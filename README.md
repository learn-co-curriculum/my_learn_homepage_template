## II. MODULE PROJECT INFO/PROCESS

- Your projects and associated Learn.co lessons can all be found on the [Portfolio Projects Section](https://learn.co/tracks/data-science-career-v2/portfolio-projects) on Learn.
- Project deadlines are on the Google Calendar at the top of this homepage.

### PROJECT SUBMISSIONS

#### 1. "Soft" Deadline AKA "Project Links Deadline"

- Full time: 1 week after project start date.
- Part time: 2 weeks after project start date.

- All required project links must be **entered on the sidebar of the project's Learn.co lesson page** and make sure to **check "I'm done"** at the bottom of the sidebar.
  - Note: you can continue to update your project after turning in the links.

- **Schedule your project review as soon as you turn in your links** (see next section below.)

- **Q: What if I don't have all pieces of my project finished by the soft deadline?**

  - For your notebook and presentation: 

    - You may continue to update your repo's contents up until your scheduled project review.

  - For the video/blog post/READMEs:
    - See "HOW TO USE PLACEHOLDER LINKS FOR Videos & Blog Posts" below

#### 2. SCHEDULE YOUR PROJECT REVIEW

- Use the link below to schedule your project review with me ASAP.
  - [Schedule a Project Review](https://go.oncehub.com/ModProjectReviews)
  - The earlier you schedule your first review, the more time you will have to schedule a second review, if required. 
  - Please push any final changes before your scheduled project review.

#### 3. "Hard" Deadline AKA "Successfully Passing Your Project Review" Deadline

- YOU **MUST SUCCESSFULLY PASS YOUR PROJECT REVIEW WITHIN 2 WEEKS AFTER THE SOFT DEADLINE** / PROJECT LINK DEADLINE.

- You are allowed **as many project review attempts** as you can fit in before the hard deadline.

- Schedule your first review as soon as possible, so you have sufficient time to re-present the project before the hard deadline.

## III. Installing and activating Jupyter Notebook Extensions - [Study Group Video on JNE](https://youtu.be/Fl7Xwr_kUkw)

- In your terminal enter the following commands:

  ```shell
  conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
  jupyter nbextension enable jupyter_nbextensions_configurator
  ```

- When you boot up jupyter notebook, click on the new tab called `nbextensions` on the jupyter notebook home page and check out the list of available extensions.
  - If the list of available notebook extensions is grayed out:
    - Uncheck "`disable configuration for nbextensions without explicit compatibility (they may break your notebook environment, but can be useful to show for nbextension development)`" at the top of the page

- **Recommended extensions to turn on:**
  - `Variable Inspector`: Lets you see details about all of the variables in your notebook.
  - `Table of Contents (2)`: Clickable sidebar with markdown headers as bookmarks/links.
  - `Collapsible Headings`: Collapse sections of your notebook using markdown headers.
  - `Codefolding`: Lets you collapse function definitions and blocks of code.
