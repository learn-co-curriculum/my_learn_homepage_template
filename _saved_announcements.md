- **If you are missing some components of the project:**
  - Blog post: please think of at least a title for your blog post and publish your rough draft/placeholder to get a blog post url.
  - Video: for now please either:
    - Submit any YouTube video link, either appropriate or humorous, up to you.
    - Create a shortened url that you can redirect using a website like rebrandly.com.
      - Use a placeholder YouTube video link to create your video url.
      - Later on, you can come back to rebrandly to edit the link that your shortened url redirects to.
  - README: See below for instructions on turning your notebook into a README for your repo.


### To convert your notebook to a markdown README:
Two methods
1)  Command line method:
Launch a terminal in the same folder as your notebook.

```
jupyter nbconvert --to markdown notebook_name.ipynb
mv README.md README_old.md
mv notebook_name.md README.md
```

2) From your project notebook:
  - Select `File` > `Download as` > `Markdown`
    - Notebook + output images will be downloaded a zip file.
  - Extract contents of zip folder to main folder of repo.
  - Rename the original `README.md` to `README_old.md`
  - Rename the notebook.md to `README.md`


## 11/18/19: Reminder: School Break Week November 25th-November 29th!

Next week Flatiron School is observing a break week. This means:

- No new curriculum will be deployed
- No instructor-led Study Groups, 1:1's or assessments will be held
- Slack will be a good place to reach out to other students for help

**How might you spend this time?**

**Play catch-up!** A little behind? This would be a great time to work through a few extra lessons so you’re ready to start back up with your cohort in a week! If you want some help figuring out how to get back on track, reach out to your instructor before break week to make a plan together.

**Take a deep dive!** Never have the time to go down a google rabbithole on your favorite data science topics? Now you do! Check out these recommended binge-reads/watches/practice:

- Practice your Python skills by playing a game:
  - https://codecombat.com/premium

- Read about topics you want to understand better in the Python Data Science Handbook
  - https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/

- Revisit past projects & labs to find code you want to reuse. Practice making your code into functions!
  - Figures/plotting is particularly good practice for writing functions. 

- Learn more about Pandas:

**RELAX!** Self-care is essential, especially when you’re dedicating all your energy and time to learning new skills. Read a novel, go for a hike, or just take a nap!

**However you choose to spend it, we hope you enjoy your break and look forward to seeing you when classes resume on December 2nd!**
